## `Meme Api Implementation using Volley`

[âœ… Check-out the GitHub profile of this meme API!](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api)

### Here just I'm Going to show you how to implement an API in Android application using volley.
- implement volley dependency in your build.gradale file.
- showing meme image and meme text on button click.
- As this is a very beginner friendly project so here i just used only one end point of this api, which is - [https://meme-api.com/gimme](https://meme-api.com/gimme)

Don't know about the `end-point` and `base url`? here is a quick guide 
- just remember `base url` + `end-point` = `results`
- examples of `base url` : `instagram.com/` or `github.com/`
- examples of `end-points`: `arjungupta0817` or `arjungupta08`
- So `github.com/arjungupta08` = `results`
